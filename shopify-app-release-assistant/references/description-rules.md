# App Details / Description — Full Rules

The app description (Deliverable #4) is the most scrutinized piece of listing copy. These are all the constraints Shopify enforces:

## Length
- Minimum: 100 characters
- Maximum: 2,800 characters
- Markdown formatting is supported

## Allowed
- Plain text prose describing what the app does
- Markdown paragraph breaks
- Bullet lists (for features within prose context)

## Not Allowed
- **Links** of any kind (URLs, mailto, anchor tags)
- **Bold**, *italics*, ~~strikethrough~~, or underline formatting
- References to other apps or services by name
- Statistics, data claims, or metrics (e.g., "increases conversions by 30%")
- Superlatives: "the first," "the best," "the only," "#1"
- Support information (email, chat, phone)
- Testimonials or reviews
- Excessive marketing keywords (keyword stuffing)
- Structured feature lists with no descriptive prose (a bare bullet list is not enough)

## Writing Approach
1. **Open with the merchant's pain point** — what problem do they face today?
2. **Introduce the app as the solution** — how does it address that pain?
3. **Detail features as benefits** — for each feature, explain what the merchant gains
4. **Close with who it's for** — ideal merchant profile or use case

## Common Rejection Reasons
- Description is just a feature list with no context
- Contains links (even to the developer's own site)
- Uses claims like "best in class" or cites conversion statistics
- Too short to give merchants confidence to install
- Too technical — describes API internals instead of merchant outcomes
